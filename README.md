# Safety Features:
- It is designed with a shroud
- You can adjust the speed with a knob, allowing for smooth speed control suited for any situations
- It has an integrated battery protection system, preventing thermal runaways when an electrical error occured, and ensuring the batteries are not overcharged, and preventing the battery to reach 0% fully, as it can permanently damage the batteries
- Uses 2 Litium Ion batteries for higher energy density, safer discharge, and longer cycle life than Li-Po batteries
- The motor is a Brushless DC motor, allowing it to run faster, consumes lower power, and can operate comfortable for hours without overheating
